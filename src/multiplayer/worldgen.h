 * The host generates spawn positions using a session seed. The spawn_table

 *
 * Design constraints:
 * - Same seed + same player count + same empire = same spawn positions
 * - Minimum distance between player cities enforced
 * - Minimum distance from AI cities enforced
 * - Connectivity guarantee: each player city has at least one valid trade route possibility
 * - Fairness: balanced land/sea access, balanced route opening costs
 * - If XML defines explicit multiplayer slots, those are used as hard constraints
